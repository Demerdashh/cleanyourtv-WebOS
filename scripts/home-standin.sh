# Stands in for LG's Home program on TVs where LG's Home is the native app (tvprofile.js homeTakeover 'standin'). 10-cleanyourtv-home
# bind-mounts this file over that program, so the app manager (SAM) keeps LG's Home manifest and starts this script whenever Home is
# launched; it does not have to be restarted (issues 14, 23 and 24). The script asks webapp-mgr to open the launcher as
# com.webos.app.home and stays running. It also tries to register with SAM as Home: then the Home key sends it a "relaunch" and the
# launcher is shown again; without registration SAM restarts this script on the Home key, which shows the launcher the same way.
# Every step is written to /tmp/cleanyourtv-boot.log, which Share log includes.
